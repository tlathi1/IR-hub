# IR-hub
An IR Hub is an Arduino-based device designed to learn, decode, store, and transmit infrared (IR) signals from remote controls or other IR-emitting devices. It acts as a universal IR controller, enabling users to automate or replicate commands for IR-controlled appliances (e.g., TVs, ACs, lights).
